These technologies together form a complete artificial intelligence technology map for Unisound. At the application level, three major solutions—AI Core, AIUI, and AI Service—support the implementation of Unisound's core technologies, which have been widely applied in home, automotive, medical, and educational fields, creating a complete "cloud core" ecological closed loop.

Since its establishment, Unisound has experienced rapid growth and has garnered widespread attention in the artificial intelligence industry and capital markets, accumulating nearly $100 million in financing and partnering with over 20,000 companies, covering more than 250 million devices. Additionally, Unisound has been selected for two consecutive years as one of Forbes China's Top 50 Fastest Growing Tech Companies and is one of the fastest-growing startups in China's artificial intelligence industry.

Unisound's revenue increased from 456 million yuan in 2021 to 727 million yuan in 2023, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.3%. Gross profit rose from 145 million yuan in 2021 to 295 million yuan in 2023, with a CAGR of 42.5%. By business segment, nearly 80% of Unisound's revenue comes from smart living services.

In May 2023, riding the wave of large models, Unisound released the Shanhai large model with 60 billion parameters, which is an evolution and improvement of the UniCore model. According to the prospectus, compared to UniCore, the Shanhai model has a larger parameter and data scale, stronger generative capabilities, and multilingual and basic knowledge abilities.

Aside from public opinion controversies, continuous losses have also become a focal point of external attention. Currently, Unisound's loss issues still exist but have shown a narrowing trend.
