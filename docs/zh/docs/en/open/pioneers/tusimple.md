# TuSimple

[TuSimple](https://cn.tusimple.com/) is a company focused on autonomous driving technology, dedicated to providing customers with efficient and safe autonomous driving solutions. TuSimple excels in fields such as computer vision and deep learning, with widespread applications in public transportation and logistics.

TuSimple's domain controller products, designed and developed based on NVIDIA's DRIVE Orin SoC chip, are expected to begin mass production by the end of 2023. TuSimple held the 2023 Ecological Strategy Signing Conference in Shanghai, completing deep cooperation agreements with outstanding industry partners such as Sunny Optical, Tudatong, and Shanghai Longchuang, and launched new products for its autonomous driving perception ecosystem. TuSimple will officially announce its entry into the Japanese market and begin autonomous driving tests on the Tomei Expressway in Japan. In the same year, it received one of the first national road testing licenses for unmanned intelligent connected vehicles issued by the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, allowing it to conduct "fully unmanned testing" of Level 4 autonomous heavy trucks on designated public roads, including Yangshan Deep-Water Port and logistics parks, as well as the Donghai Bridge.

In 2024, TuSimple announced its decision to voluntarily delist its common stock from NASDAQ and terminate its common stock registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
