With the rapid rise of large language models, [iFlytek](https://www.iflytek.com/) has independently developed the Xinghuo large model to compete with ChatGPT. The Xinghuo large model is a natural language model based on deep learning, with a focus on Chinese. It possesses human-like understanding and generation capabilities across various domains and tasks, enabling it to understand user needs and execute tasks based on natural dialogue.

The company's large model continues to iterate and improve, achieving comprehensive enhancements in its capabilities.

On December 15, 2022, iFlytek launched the "1+N Cognitive Intelligence Large Model Special Project." On May 6, 2023, iFlytek released version 1.0 of the Xinghuo cognitive model, introducing seven core capabilities and a large model evaluation system. On June 9, the Xinghuo model was upgraded to version 1.5, breaking through in open-ended question answering, multi-turn dialogue capabilities, and mathematical abilities. In August, version 2.0 was released, achieving multimodal capabilities with significant improvements in coding abilities.

Xinghuo 3.0 fully benchmarks against ChatGPT. On October 24, 2023, Xinghuo launched version 3.0, with significant enhancements in semantic understanding, timely grasping, and code generation capabilities. It also demonstrates outstanding spatiotemporal awareness. The model exhibits minimal real-time errors in specialized capabilities, particularly in the medical field, providing timely diagnostic reminders. 

Xinghuo comprehensively benchmarks against ChatGPT, with objective evaluations showing its Chinese capabilities surpassing those of ChatGPT, while its English capabilities are comparable across 48 task results. According to evaluations from the Economic Research Institute of the Development Research Center of the State Council, the comprehensive capabilities of the Xinghuo large model 3.0 reach an international first-class level, excelling in the medical, legal, and educational sectors.

iFlytek also released twelve industry-specific large models covering finance, automotive interaction, telecommunications, industry, media, law, government affairs, scientific literature, housing construction, property management, cultural tourism, and water conservancy. iFlytek has officially initiated large model training to benchmark against GPT-4, aiming for alignment with GPT-4 in the first half of 2024.
