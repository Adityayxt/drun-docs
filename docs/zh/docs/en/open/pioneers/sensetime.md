# SenseTime Technology

[SenseTime Technology](https://www.sensetime.com/cn) has a strong academic foundation and has long been committed to original technology research, continuously enhancing its industry-leading capabilities in multimodal and multitasking general artificial intelligence, covering key technology areas such as perceptual intelligence, natural language processing, decision intelligence, and intelligent content generation.

On April 10, 2023, SenseTime held a technology exchange day event to share its strategic layout for advancing AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) through "large models + large computing power," and announced its "Daily New SenseNova" large model system under this strategy. They introduced various large models and capabilities, including natural language processing, content generation, automated data annotation, and custom model training. Relying on its self-developed natural language model with hundreds of billions of parameters, SenseTime launched the Chinese language large model application platform "SenseChat" on April 10.

"SenseChat" is an artificial intelligence large language model developed by SenseTime based on natural language processing technology, possessing strong language understanding and generation capabilities. It can solve complex problems, provide customized suggestions, and assist in text creation, while also having the ability to continuously learn and evolve. On July 7, "SenseChat" was iterated to version 2.0, with its base model being the ShushengÂ·Puyu InternLM-123B released in collaboration with several top domestic research institutions, boasting 123 billion parameters and leading industry standards in language, knowledge, understanding, reasoning, and five major capabilities.
