# Compute Market

The compute market refers to a platform established where independent compute resource
providers offer various GPU resources and services to users. Users can select suitable
resource types and billing methods to create container instances based on their actual needs.

- Pay-as-you-go: Cost = Duration * Unit Price

    Duration = Shutdown Time - Startup Time, accurate to the second; no charges during startup or waiting periods.
    (Hourly billing is supported; if usage is less than an hour, charges will be based on actual usage time, accurate to the second.)

- Annual and Monthly Packages: Annual and monthly packages will soon be supported, with more favorable pricing for single cards. Stay tuned.
- Resource Types: Types of GPU resources that can be purchased based on demand when inventory is sufficient.
