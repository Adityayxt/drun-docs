# Container Instance Power On/Off

After the container instance is created, it supports power off and power on operations. Powering on starts billing, while powering off stops billing.

## Power Off

Prerequisites: A container instance has been created and is currently running.

The steps are as follows:

1. Log in to d.run, go to **Compute Cloud** -> **Container Instances** ,
   select a running instance, click the **...** on the right side of the list,
   and choose **Power Off** from the dropdown list.

!!! note

    - Currently, powering off an instance does not support saving the system disk, please ensure data backup is done. Support is expected in February 2025.
    - Instances that have not been powered on for 15 days will be automatically released.
    - GPU resources will not be reserved after power off. If there are insufficient
      available GPU resources of the required model when powering back on, you will need to wait.

## Power On

Prerequisites: A container instance has been created and is currently powered off.

The steps are as follows:

1. Log in to d.run, go to **Compute Cloud** -> **Container Instances** ,
   select a powered-off instance, click the **...** on the right side of the list,
   and choose **Start Instance** from the dropdown list.

    <!-- ![Power On 1](./images/poweron1.png) -->

2. If the required GPU resources are sufficient, click **OK** to start.
   If resources are insufficient, you may need to wait.

!!! note

    - Instances that are queued or starting do not incur charges; billing begins when in running status.
    - Container instances do not actively refresh their status;
      you need to manually refresh to check the real status of the container instance.
