# App Chat Instructions

**Chat** is the most common way to obtain information since the emergence of ChatGPT. In d.run, once an app is published, the conversation function can be used. You can freely ask questions in the conversation after linking to a corpus, consult historical records at any time, and the navigation bar also lists the recently used chats.

## Chat Management

<!-- ![manage](../images/manage.jpg) -->

- **Pin**, **Rename**, and **Delete**: In the history pane, click the **‚îá** on the right side of a chat to pin, rename, or delete the conversation.
- **Clear**: In the upper left corner of the conversation page, click the üßπ icon to **clear** the conversation.
- **Link Corpus**: In the lower left corner of the input box, click the üìñ icon to link the corpus.

    Selection of corpus: The **chat app** will match the most similar corpus in the selected corpus as a reference to answer your questions. A successful operation will indicate that the corpus has been selected. You can also deselect one or more corpora.

    !!! info

        If you cannot select or change the linked corpus, you can only add a corpus. The vectorization model of the app must be consistent with the vectorization model of the corpus to be usable.

- **Stop Chat**: After asking a question, click the icon on the right side of the input box to stop the conversation, allowing the assistant to cease outputting content.

## Some Useful Icons

<!-- ![page-function](../images/page-function.jpg) -->

- **Rating**: You can like üëç or dislike üëé a response, depending on your satisfaction with the content of the answer.
- **Copy**: You can copy a response.
- **Reset**: You can reset or regenerate a specific response.

    !!! info "Randomness"

        For the reset content, the administrator can adjust the model's **randomness** to control the consistency of the assistant's responses over multiple attempts.

        If the randomness is high, the assistant's responses may vary each time. If high accuracy is required, the randomness can be lowered, resulting in more consistent outputs from the assistant each time.

- **Delete**: Click the trash can :material-delete: icon to delete a response, after which the deleted chat will not be remembered in the context of the assistant's conversation.
- **Feedback**: Click the last icon :bookmark_tabs: of a response to submit feedback, providing comments based on the quality of the assistant's responses.
