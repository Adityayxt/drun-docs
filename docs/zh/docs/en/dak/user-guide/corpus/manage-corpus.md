- Click on **File Segments** at the top to enter the file segment details, where you can view all segment information of the file.
- Enter a description of the file segment to search for specific segments, where text similarity is used to measure the similarity between the search content and the segments in the corpus. Here, the **Euclidean distance** is used as a similarity calculation metric, so the smaller the similarity, the closer the distance, and the more similar the text.
- In the file segments, click the **┇** button of a specific segment to edit the corpus segment content or delete a specific segment.
