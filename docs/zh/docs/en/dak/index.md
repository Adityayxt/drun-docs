# What is Intelligent Q&A

The d.run intelligent Q&A product utilizes RAG technology to vectorize user data, and then combines a large language model with similarity search to query the user data repository, achieving knowledge-based Q&A. 
This method addresses the issues of user privacy data protection and model hallucination, resulting in more accurate and personalized responses.

Here, you can create apps and plugins to build a corpus for AI conversations, and then optimize user experience through data analysis feedback.
